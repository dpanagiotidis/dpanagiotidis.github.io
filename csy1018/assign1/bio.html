			<h1>About Dimitris</h1>
			<p1>Dimitris loves to occupy with computers and learn new things about them,<br>
			he specializes in video games in particular,and enjoys team enviroment in general.<br>
			He is really competitive,in fact he gets really annoyed when he lose but still<br>
			every loss is a lesson and he learns from his mistakes.</p1>
			<br><br>
			<p1>The love for computers and games, made him realise that he could actually<br>
				make a career on programing games, so one day other kids will feel the same<br>
				magic he found on games like when he was a kid.
			</p1>
			<br><br>
			<p1>He usually listens to rap songs for motivation,but grew up with house music<br>
				and he enjoys good electronic music.While listening to music he can be seen playing<br>
				video games for hours on his computer or taking a walk to the city's center to meet his friends<br>
			</p1>
			<br>
			<p1>Coffee is the best way to start the day, from time to time like everybody he could use<br>
				a really good sleep to relax from a hard day<br>
				(or just sleep because sleep is good for health)...
			</p1>
			<h2>Right now...?</h2>
			<p2>Dimitris is a student in DEI college and study Computing.While being away<br>
				from his video games for his studies he occasionally sometimes takes a break<br>
				and plays.Currently he has 3 assessments and he has to focus on them to pass<br>
				the semester.
